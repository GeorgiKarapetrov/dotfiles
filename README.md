# Messy Dotfiles
[Manage your dotfiles with a bare repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)

The install script will clone this repo as a bare repo in in `$HOME/.dotfiles`.

Then it will checkout the files with work tree in '$HOME'. In the process it will place the README, the license and itself in the $HOME folder, together with a bunch of poorly organized files all over '$HOME'.

**Do not run blindly!**
