# Dotfiles
[Manage your dotfiles with a bare repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)

The install script will clone this repo as a bare repo in in `$HOME/.dotfiles`.

Then it will modify system files in `/etc`, `/boot`, and `/usr` as well as your home folder. In the process it will place the readme, the license and itslef in the root of your file system.

**Do not run blindly!**
